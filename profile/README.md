### Our projects
#### CastleConquest 2
CastleConquest 2 is the project we are currently working on. It is the successor to CastleConquest 1 / BurgConquest.
As the name suggests, it is about conquering or defending a castle.
The standard game mode will be Conquest (like CastleConquest 1), but Rush, Extraction, Siege and Lynchmob are also planned as game modes (but will be delivered later).

#### ACM-2
A large map that has multiple pvp gamemodes.
  
Rush:  
As an attacker, you need to blow up the defenders' targets. As a defender, you need to prevent the enemies from blowing up your targets.  
The attackers have only a limited amount of respawns and time.  
The game mode is based on the Rush mode from Battlefield 3/4.
  
Team Deathmatch:  
Both teams have a specific amounts of respawns. The first team that has no respawns anymore loses.
  
Capture the Flag:  
Take the flag from the enemy base to your own base to capture it.  
After capturing a specific amount of flags, your team wins.
  
The gamemodes were created only with a datapack, no plugins were used.
  
Where to play: On our minecraft network. But sometimes it is in maintenance because of a minecraft version update.
  
Status: Finished (Will be ported to newer versions, but no new features will be added)
#### CastleConquest 1 / BurgConquest
A pvp map and gamemode where you need to capture a castle or defend it.
  
The map was created with command blocks and later also with datapacks.  
No plugins were used, this would work in vanilla.
  
Where to play: The map isn't published anywhere, but it is playable sometimes at events on our discord server.
  
Status: Finished (Will be ported to newer versions, but no new features will be added)
